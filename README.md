# Overview

This repository serves as a collection of files and scripts for a university project on Bayesian statistics focusing on learning block structures in Gaussian Graphical Models for spectrometric data analysis.

## Description

This repository contains a set of files and folders useful for data simulation and Bayesian analysis.

## Repository Structure

- `functions`: This folder contains functions used for data analysis.
- `new_simulation`: Contains files and scripts related to the simulation of new data.
- `results`: This folder contains the results of the analyses performed.
- `simulated_data`: Here are the simulated data.
- `simulated_data20`: A subfolder of `simulated_data` containing additional simulated data.
- `.RData`: R data file.
- `.Rhistory`: History of R commands used.
- `Bayesian23_example.R`: Example file for Bayesian analysis.
- `bulky_functions_old.R`: Deprecated but still used functions.
- `es1.Rmd`, `es2.Rmd`, `es3.Rmd`, `es4.Rmd`: R Markdown files for specific exercises.
- `purees.Rdat`: Pure data.
- `purees_data.Rmd`: R Markdown file related to pure data analysis.
- `simulated_data_generation.R`: Script for generating simulated data.
